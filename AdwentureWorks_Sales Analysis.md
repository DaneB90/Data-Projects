# AdwentureWorks Sales Analysis

The task is to present a Sales Analysis for AdwentureWorks company. This work consists of Dashboard and presentation.

For that I used SQL queries to extract needed data and Dashboard was built in Looker.

The Trends page provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments, order volume, and profits, comparing the current year (CY) to the previous year (PY). Additionally, this page allows for tracking the current year's key metrics, focusing specifically on the CY month.
