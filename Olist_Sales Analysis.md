We can observe distinctions between the two years of data, and upon comparison, it becomes evident that in 2018, success was more pronounced in terms of revenue and customer count. An analysis of the complete dataset indicates a prevailing trend of increasing average prices, whereas shipping costs remain relatively consistent. It's important to note that the company ships a wide array of product variations, and this average encompasses all of these variations.

A review score ranging from 1 to 5 has been collected, encompassing 99,224 reviews out of a total of 99,224 orders. This suggests that nearly all orders have been reviewed, making this measurement a significant quality metric. It's worth noting that negative reviews hold the potential to influence both revenue and customer count. Consequently, delving deeper into this metric and comprehending its correlation with packaging and order processing times could prove insightful. Notably, negative reviews are classified under the 1 and 2 categories, while positive reviews fall within the 3 to 5 range.

Negative reviews could potentially originate from users who experienced delays in their orders. Approximately 10% of the entire dataset comprises delayed orders, and these instances of delay exhibit a strong correlation with negative reviews (classified under review class 1-2). Notably, there exists a discernible trend: an increase in the number of delayed orders corresponds to a higher frequency of negative reviews.

 The first 16 categories (out of 71) comprise roughly 80% of total revenue. The top Categories by revenue are very different in size so that might come into as a problem with shipping and delayed orders. The lightest product category with the most revenue is Health & Beauty products (2444 different products) whose packaging might be smaller and easier to ship. They will be compared with the first bigger packages from the Revenue point, which are Office furniture (309 different products).

There is a difference in product categories and packaging size. When comparing Health and Beauty (small packages) to Office furniture (bigger packages) the Customer review score was a lover of Office furniture products. This lower review score might be a reason for a higher delayed order percentage for the office furniture.
